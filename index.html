<h2>Modern Warfare 2 Players Are Seemingly Being Banned For Using RGB Software </h2>
<p>
Several players have come forward with complaints to the effect that bans are accidentally being handed out in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 for RGB software. The problem seems to be false positives coming through the anti-cheat system. “Preordered Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for $70, played the campaign for just two hours only to wake up on launch day to a permanently banned account for literally no reason whatsoever,” one player said about the issue.</p>

 <h2>Upcoming Overwatch 2 Update Nerfs Genji, Zarya, D.Va, Sombra, Kiriko
Genji, Zarya, D.Va, Sombra, and Kiriko</h2>

<p>players are about to have their favorite heroes nerfed. The update won’t be going live until November 15, but the studio behind Overwatch 2, Blizzard, has already made the announcement. “With several weeks in the books, we’ve been so humbled and honored that over 25 million players have answered the call to Overwatch 2,” a spokesperson for the company said on the official forums. “With the live service now more stable, we’d like to take some time to focus on what we have planned for hero balance in an upcoming game update, prior to the changes that we have planned for Season 2.” Blizzard previously promised that no balance changes would be coming in the near future.</p>

<h2>Dungeon Defenders Studio Chromatic Games Called Crunch "Passion Hours" </h2>
<p>

The studio known mostly for Dungeon Defenders, Chromatic Games, apparently referred to the practice of crunch as putting in “passion hours,” much to the dismay of employees. While the company has righted some of the wrongs which surfaced in a report from several years ago about working conditions, crunch clearly remains a concern. Some employees recently described how they felt compelled to put in between nine and 12 hour days.
